## Overview

This repository is a part of Object-Oriented Programming lab exercises. Each program demonstrates a specific OOP concept or feature, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and file handling.

## Programs

### Assignment 1: Complex Number Operations

- **File**: [Assingment1.cpp](Assingment1.cpp)
- **Description**: Implements a `Complex` class to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and comparisons on complex numbers. Demonstrates operator overloading and exception handling.

### Assignment 2: Student Management System

- **File**: [Assingment2.cpp](Assingment2.cpp)
- **Description**: Implements a `Student` class with attributes like name, roll number, class, division, and more. Demonstrates constructors, destructors, friend functions, and dynamic memory allocation.

### Assignment 3: Publication Management

- **File**: [Assingment3.cpp](Assingment3.cpp)
- **Description**: Implements a base `Publication` class and derived classes `Book` and `Tape`. Demonstrates inheritance, polymorphism, and templates for input validation.

### Assignment 4: File Handling Example

- **File**: [Assingment4.cpp](Assingment4.cpp)
- **Description**: Demonstrates file handling in C++. Writes data to a file and reads it back, showcasing the use of `ofstream` and `ifstream`.

### Assignment 5: Generic Selection Sort

- **File**: [Assingment5.cpp](Assingment5.cpp)
- **Description**: Implements a generic selection sort algorithm using templates. Demonstrates sorting arrays of integers and floats.

### Assignment 6: Personal Records Management

- **File**: [Assingment6.cpp](Assingment6.cpp)
- **Description**: Manages personal records with attributes like name, date of birth, and phone number. Demonstrates the use of STL containers (`std::vector`), sorting, and searching.

### Assignment 7: State Population Lookup

- **File**: [Assingment7.cpp](Assingment7.cpp)
- **Description**: Uses a `std::map` to store and retrieve the population of Indian states. Demonstrates the use of associative containers and user input handling.
